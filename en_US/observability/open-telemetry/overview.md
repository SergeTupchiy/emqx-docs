# Integrate with OpenTelemetry

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) is an observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. Crucially, OpenTelemetry is vendor- and tool-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with a broad variety of Observability backends, including open source tools like Jaeger and Prometheus, as well as commercial offerings.

EMQX has built-in support for all the OpenTelemtr signals:

- [Metrics](./metrics.md)
- [Traces](./traces.md)
- [Logs](./logs.md)
